Sometime oyu are in red zone farming anff you want just tp chill on your phone a little bit, or maybe you'd want to go to the bathroom real quick. Then this scripts will make a warning (you can modify the "warning"). In this case there os a voice that "speaks up" the number of pk's.

## How to use?

This code works for screens with a resolution of 1920x1080 (the same resolution as Albion).

If you want to use another resolution, you need to change the coordinate points where screenshots are taken based on the number of PKs on the map. You can obtain these points using the MouseCoordinates.py script.
